Overview:  For this scenario, we have been asked to write an application that will be  used to provide information about baseball player statistics.  Approach this  problem as if it is an application going to production.  We don't expect it  to be perfect (no production code is), but we also don't want you to hack  together a throw-away script.  This should be representative of something  that you would be comfortable releasing to a production environment.  Also,  spend whatever amount of time you think is reasonable.  If you don't get all  the requirements completed, that's ok.  Just do the best you can with the  time that you have available.  You may use whatever gems, frameworks and  tools that you think are appropriate, just provide any special setup  instructions when you submit your solution.Assumptions:  All requests currently are based on data in the hitting file.  Future  requests of the system will require data from a pitching file as well.  Consider this in the design.Requirements:  When the application is run, use the provided data and calculate the  following results and write them to STDOUT.1) Most improved batting average( hits / at-bats) from 2009 to 2010.  Only   include players with at least 200 at-bats.2) Slugging percentage for all players on the Oakland A's (teamID = OAK) in   2007. 3) Who was the AL and NL triple crown winner for 2011 and 2012.  If no one won   the crown, output "(No winner)"Formulas:  Batting average =>    hits / at-bats  Slugging percentage =>    ((Hits – doubles – triples – home runs) + (2 * doubles) + (3 * triples) + (4 * home runs)) / at-bats  Triple crown winner    The player that had the highest batting average AND the most home runs AND    the most RBI in their league. It's unusual for someone to win this, but    there was a winner in 2012. “Officially” the batting title (highest league    batting average) is based on a minimum of 502 plate appearances. The    provided dataset does not include plate appearances. It also does not    include walks so plate appearances cannot be calculated. Instead, use a    constraint of a minimum of 400 at-bats to determine those eligible for the    league batting title.Data:  All the necessary data is available in the two csv files attached:Batting-07-12.csv:  Contains all the batting statistics from 2007-2012.  Column header key:  AB – at-bats  H – hits  2B – doubles  3B – triples  HR – home runs  RBI – runs batted inMaster-small.csv  Contains the demographic data for all baseball players in history through 2012.Please note:  We are looking for you to demonstrate you knowledge related to common  software practices to include reusability, portability, and encapsulation –  to name a few. Work submitted should be in project form and implemented as  you were implementing any production solution.
